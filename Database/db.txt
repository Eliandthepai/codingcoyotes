Designing a database schema for an online merch store involves identifying the entities (such as products, customers, orders, etc.) and their relationships. Below is a basic schema for such a store:

Entities:

a. Product:

ProductID (Primary Key)
Name
Description
Price
StockQuantity
CategoryID (Foreign Key referencing Category table)
b. Category:

CategoryID (Primary Key)
Name
c. Customer:

CustomerID (Primary Key)
FirstName
LastName
Email
Password
Address
City
State
ZipCode
d. Order:

OrderID (Primary Key)
CustomerID (Foreign Key referencing Customer table)
OrderDate
TotalAmount
e. OrderItem:

OrderItemID (Primary Key)
OrderID (Foreign Key referencing Order table)
ProductID (Foreign Key referencing Product table)
Quantity
UnitPrice
Relationships:

A product belongs to one category, but a category can have many products. (One-to-Many relationship: Category to Product)
A customer can place many orders, but an order belongs to one customer. (One-to-Many relationship: Customer to Order)
An order can contain multiple items, and an item can belong to only one order. (One-to-Many relationship: Order to OrderItem)
A product can be part of many orders, and an order can contain multiple products. (Many-to-Many relationship: Product to OrderItem)
Indexes:

Indexes can be added on frequently searched columns like ProductID, CustomerID, OrderID for faster retrieval.
Constraints:

Foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity.
Check constraints on fields like Price to ensure it's non-negative.
Normalization:

Ensure the database is normalized up to at least 3rd normal form to minimize redundancy and maintain data integrity.
Additional Considerations:

Incorporate security measures like hashing passwords.
Consider adding fields for tracking order status (e.g., pending, shipped, delivered).
Implement features for managing discounts, promotions, and customer reviews.
This schema provides a basic structure for an online merch store. Depending on specific requirements and business needs, additional tables and fields might be necessary.
