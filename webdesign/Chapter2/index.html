  <!--In the CSS box model, every HTML element is treated as a box with four areas.
Imagine you receive a box from your favorite online retailer -- 
1. The content: The element
is the item in the box, or in our case, a header, paragraph, or image element.
2. Padding: bubblewrap.
The content is surrounded by a space called padding, similar to how bubble wrap separates an item from the box around it.
3. Border:
Think of the border like the cardboard box your item was shipped in.
4. Margin:
is the area outside of the box, and can be used to control the space between other boxes or elements.
